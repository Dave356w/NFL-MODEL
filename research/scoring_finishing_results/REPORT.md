# Scoring opportunities and finishing: earlier-season margin study

**Decision: retain for research; no production adoption supported.**

Basis: exposed historical reconstruction, not native forward evidence. Coefficients are pooled across all teams,
fitted on 2023 for 2024, 2023-24 for 2025, and 2023-25 for the separate 2026 diagnostic.
Primary source lag is two week indices; one-week sensitivity was fixed in advance. No ROI-selected settings.

All ATS returns below risk 1u at assumed -110; these differ from the public page's mixed-price returns.
Cover probability is a research discretized-Gaussian margin approximation, conditioned on no push,
not an existing saved production probability. Its scale is fitted on prior-season training residuals.

**Methodological caution:** the production map targets a median margin, while this study fits squared-error
mean residuals. Its intercept shifts toward a mean, not a refitted median. Earlier-season residual medians
are zero even though their means are positive. These are mean-margin overlays, not clean tests of adding
features to the production ATS median. See ../ats_median_audit/REPORT.md before interpreting adoption.

The intercept-only control separates adding the new statistics from merely recalibrating the base margin.
The original model retains its original mapped margin without this intercept adjustment.

Market_original is the same-row always-favorite action baseline. Always-home has no margin forecast.
Fair_cover is a .5 probability benchmark; its displayed action uses the same favorite-on-zero-edge convention.
Cover rates exclude pushes; ROI includes pushes; skip counts and cover rates are in metrics.csv.

## Increment over the intercept-only control

Positive gain favors the new statistics. Paired whole-week bootstrap within season, 10,000 draws.
These are nominal 95% intervals, not corrected for both feature families or prior research selection.

## Audit and limits

- Frozen forecasts and input hashes are in ../pressure_inputs; feature-source coverage is in the corresponding input directory.
- All source statistics precede the prediction by the declared lag; fit labels are from earlier seasons only.
- Historical source files were revised after games. Asset modification time is not original row publication time.
  The lag is a conservative assumption, not proof of point-in-time availability. Latest PBP has week-10 2026 data
  while PFR pressure ends in week 9; missing pressure is excluded, never treated as zero.
- PBP-defined opportunities and rounded PFR pressure percentages mostly agree; convention mismatches are counted in pressure_inputs/coverage.json.
- Reliability by five fixed probability bins is in reliability.csv. Pick accuracy is not calibration.
- Only two full evaluation seasons and a partially completed current season are available under the comparable mapped base.
- No production fit, notebook, lock, journal, public page or betting policy is modified.

Fourth-down decision features measure contextual aggressiveness, not optimal go/punt/FG regret.
Fourth-down execution conditions on selected attempts. True counterfactual decision values remain unimplemented.
