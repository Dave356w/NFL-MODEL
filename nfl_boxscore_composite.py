v1.7 (NEW experiment: new REVISION and OUTPUT_ROOT; the v1.6 folder, frozen
recipe and forward ledger are left untouched): opponent-adjusted availability.
  * New family 'rates_core_adj_avail_cs' = the opponent-adjusted core stats of
    'rates_core_adj' (v1.3) plus the current-season availability layer of
    'rates_core_avail_cs' (v1.6). The unadjusted v1.6 winner stays in the
    candidate set, so walk-forward selection decides whether adjustment helps.
  * Candidate families trimmed to the two above (24 candidates instead of 36);
    rates_core and rates_core_avail lost to rates_core_avail_cs in v1.6.
  * Manifest limitations and board footer describe opponent adjustment
    according to the selected recipe.

v1.6.5 (speed only; same REVISION, signature, recipe, ledger and outputs):
computed availability features for completed seasons are cached per season
under OUTPUT_ROOT/cache, so each run rebuilds only the current season's
team-weeks. A season's cache key hashes the config signature and every input
that season can read: its schedule rows and the injury, roster, snap and QB
rows for that season and the MAX_HISTORY_SEASONS before it. Any upstream or
config change therefore rebuilds that season. Per-season audit counts are
stored beside each cache file, so the printed roster-membership totals still
cover all seasons.

v1.6.4 (reporting only; same REVISION, signature, recipe and ledger): realized
pick records in matched bands, game-card style. Each source "picks" the side it
makes the favorite; pick confidence is binned on the SAME edges for model and
market (PICK_BAND_EDGES: 50-55, 55-60, ... 80%+). For every band, the board and
printout show each source's W-L record, average pick probability and realized
pick win rate (Wilson 95%). Every game card adds a line with the model's record
in the model's band for that game and the market's record in the market's band.
Records use held-out seasons plus earlier weeks of the current season, all
walk-forward reconstructions; the current week never feeds its own records.
The v1.6.3 home-win calibration is still saved to calibration_bands.csv.

v1.6.3 (reporting only; same REVISION, signature, recipe and ledger): calibration
in matched bands. Every held-out game is binned twice on the SAME home-win
probability edges (CAL_BAND_EDGES): once by the model's forecast, once by the
market's. Each band reports games, mean forecast and realized home-win rate with
a Wilson 95% interval; the board shows a reliability chart and table.

v1.6.2 (storage only; same REVISION, signature, recipe and ledger): in Colab,
OUTPUT_ROOT lives on Google Drive (MyDrive/nfl_boxscore/<OUTPUT_NAME>),
so the frozen recipe, forward ledger, caches and run folders survive sessions.
Drive is mounted on first run (one authorization prompt). A local folder left
by an earlier session in this runtime is copied over once, never overwriting
anything already on Drive; forward-ledger records are merged by experiment and
game. Outside Colab, or with USE_GOOGLE_DRIVE=False, the local folder is used.

v1.6.1 (reporting only; same REVISION, config signature, frozen recipe and
forward ledger as v1.6, so no restart): adds a market-blend diagnostic and
fixes two stale board labels. Predictions are unchanged.
  * Market-blend check: logistic regression of home W/L on the spread's
    log-odds and the composite's log-odds. (a) Pooled held-out fit with a
    game-bootstrap interval for the composite weight: is it reliably nonzero?
    (b) Chronological blend: weights fitted on earlier walk-forward seasons
    (same recipe), applied to each held-out season, scored against the market.
    Earlier seasons also informed recipe selection, so (b) is mildly optimistic.

v1.6: availability fixes found in the v1.5 run (NEW experiment: new REVISION
and OUTPUT_ROOT; earlier folders and forward ledgers are left untouched).
  * Bye weeks: weekly rosters have no row for a team on bye, so the game after
    every bye had no "prior week" roster and membership/status silently
    switched off (about 220 team-weeks). The reference roster is now the
    team's MOST RECENT roster week before the forecast week.
  * QB projection: only players listed at QB on the reference roster can be
    projected. If none of them has dropbacks for the team (e.g. starter out,
    backup newly signed), the projection is the league backup prior and the
    board says so, instead of naming a gadget passer with one trick-play throw.
  * New candidate family 'rates_core_avail_cs': identical to rates_core_avail,
    except unit unavailability uses only current-season games once a team has
    CS_MIN_GAMES of them, so last season's finale (and offseason departures in
    it) stops counting once this season's lineup is visible.

v1.5: availability fix and labelling (NEW experiment: new REVISION and OUTPUT_ROOT;
the v1.4 folder, frozen recipe and forward ledger are left untouched).
  * Roster membership: a player with snaps or dropbacks in the window who is NOT
    on the team's reference roster has left the team and now counts as fully
    unavailable. Before, only injury-report status and an explicit prior-week
    RES/CUT/TRD/... row marked anyone out, so departed free agents (the window
    spans the season boundary in weeks 1-3), traded players, and a departed
    starting QB still counted as available.
    Reference roster = PRIOR week's roster; week 1 uses the week-1 roster's
    membership (set at final cutdown, well before kickoff; it can only remove
    players). If more than MEMBERSHIP_MAX_SHARE of a team's window snaps are
    off the reference roster, that roster is treated as an ID/coverage gap and
    membership is skipped for that team-week (audited).
  * 'qb_delta' relabelled: it is the projected QB's efficiency minus the
    team's recent dropback-weighted QB mix, so it is nonzero without any
    change (usually positive: starters beat mop-up/backup snaps).
  * Large-gap warning, footer and manifest no longer claim the availability
    model lacks injury/QB/roster information.

v1.4: adds 'rates_core_avail' = core stats + player availability, using only
information published before kickoff:
  * QB layer: if the usual passer is listed Out/Doubtful (or was moved off the
    roster by the PRIOR week), the next passer by recent dropbacks is projected
    and the feature is the expected net yards per dropback of the projected QB
    minus the team's recent QB mix (each QB shrunk toward backup-level efficiency).
  * Unit availability: for OL, WR/TE, RB, DL, LB and DB, the share of the unit's
    snaps over the team's last 4 games belonging to players listed Out/Doubtful
    (Questionable counts a quarter), or moved to reserve/cut/traded by the prior week.
  Snap counts that reveal who actually played the forecast game are never used.
  Same-week roster STATUS is deliberately ignored because its timing is unknown.

v1.3: adds 'rates_core_adj', the same 8 core stats adjusted for opponents
faced. Each week, using prior games only, a weighted ridge fit splits every
stat into league mean + offense effect + defense effect, so a defense that
faced weak offenses is no longer credited for it.

v1.2: adds a 'rates_core' family (8 stats per side, one per idea) and drops
total yards from box_totals (it equals passing + rushing exactly).

v1.1 changes (design fixes found by code review, applied after v1 results were
seen, so this is a NEW experiment with its own OUTPUT_ROOT and forward ledger):
  * Recipe selection: v1's season-cluster one-SE rule passed all 18 candidates
    with only three validation seasons, so the tie-break (fewest inputs,
    strongest ridge, longest half-life) chose rates_h16_r0.1 regardless of
    data. v1.1 selects the minimum walk-forward log loss; SEs stay diagnostic.
  * Ridge grid extended upward: v1's best candidates sat at the 0.1 boundary.
  * Defensive possession share dropped: it is exactly 100 minus offensive
    share, so the pair was a duplicated feature (mirror coefficients).
  * Backtest starts 2021 with outer tests 2023-2025 (v1 had one outer season).
  * Board redesigned: slate summary, final scores with hit/miss, readable
    feature names, diverging contribution bars, better-side highlighting,
    large model-market gaps flagged, kickoffs in TIMEZONE, scoped CSS.

The user's box-score stat types feed lagged offense and defense profiles.
The logistic composite learns W/L weights from PAST games, not a game's own
final statistics. Team profiles decay by games played; coefficient training
also discounts old games. Half-life, feature family and ridge penalty are
chosen only from earlier-season walk-forward predictions. Coefficients are
refitted each week; the chosen recipe is frozen for the current season.

Market spread is a benchmark only: it never enters the composite fit or
selection. Player availability enters only through the *_avail families;
opponent adjustment only through the *_adj families.

PBP-derived box scores are reconstructions, not guaranteed official totals.
Penalty count is an accepted-yard penalized-play proxy (multiple penalties on
one play may be undercounted); possession time is deduplicated source drive
metadata with coverage checks. Fumbles are assigned to source fumble/recovery
teams where available; fallback attribution is audited. A clean official team-
game CSV can replace PBP aggregation via TEAM_GAME_CSV (schema below).
Historical source revisions and this new design prevent calling backtests
untouched forecasts. Only first snapshots actually written before kickoff go
into the separate forward ledger. Preserve OUTPUT_ROOT across Colab sessions.
