"""Commit generated `data/` files through the GitHub API, so they land signed.

A `git push` from Actions produces an UNVERIFIED commit. The runner holds no
signing key and `github-actions[bot]` is only an author email, so GitHub has
nothing to verify -- every ledger commit this repo has ever made shows that
way. Commits created through the GraphQL `createCommitOnBranch` mutation are
signed by GitHub itself with the same content and the same bot author, and
show as Verified.

Two properties of the old `git add` / `git commit` / `git pull --rebase` /
`git push` sequence are load-bearing and are preserved here:

* **A failure must never cost a forecast.** The build commits first pregame
  snapshots to `data/forward_predictions.jsonl`, and `record_forward` only
  accepts a snapshot taken before kickoff, so rows that fail to land cannot be
  re-derived later without lookahead. The API path is newer and less proven than `git push`, so any
  failure of it falls back to exactly the old sequence: the data lands
  unverified rather than not at all, with a workflow warning saying so.
* **The push must not retrigger the workflow.** Commits made with the
  repository's `GITHUB_TOKEN` do not create new workflow runs, and that holds
  for API-created commits as much as for pushed ones.

Concurrency is handled the way `git push` handles it, not by blind retry:
`expectedHeadOid` pins the branch tip the commit is built on, and if the tip
moved under us we re-read it and retry ONLY when the intervening commit
touched none of the files we are sending. If it touched one of ours, this
exits non-zero rather than silently overwriting someone else's write -- the
same refusal `git pull --rebase` gives on a conflict.
